# For GitHub Enterprise Cloud enterprises that are using Enterprise Managed Users (EMUs) and SAML authentication, this GraphQL query will print a list (first 100 in this example) of the SCIM identities (specifically, the SCIM `username` attribute) and the linked GitHub usernames.
# This query will not work for enterprises that do not use EMUs, as SCIM provisioning cannot be enabled at the enterprise level for enterprises that do not use EMUs.j
# Modifying this query to also show member SAML identities will not work for EMU enterprises, since SAML identities are not currently stored for enterprises that use EMUs. 
# This query will also not work for EMU enterprises that are using Azure AD OIDC for authentication.
